## About me

Hello there!  I am Rick Stehmeyer, I am a 22 year veteran of the building automation systems (BAS) industry.  I have created this github profile to start sharing things that might help others reduce their cabon footprint in the build enviroment. I am also learning the github workflow and how to be an open source contributor to projects that I think I can benefit. 

If you see anything here that might need some help, or have suggestions for me, feel free to reach out.  You can find me pretty easily these days with a quick google search.  I look forward to engaging folks here in the code community! 

Cheers, EnochRick.
